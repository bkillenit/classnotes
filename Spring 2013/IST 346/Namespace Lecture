A namespace consists of:
	A set of defined and named keys
	the attributes associated with each of the keys

Type of namespaces
	Computer names
	email addresses
	printers
	service names
	IP addresses user accounts

Types of namespaces
	Flat
		-no duplicates can exist
		-SU NetID
		-user accounts are a flat namspace

	Hierarchical
		-namespace is organized in a tree
		-duplicates can exist at nodes in the tree, but the overall name is globally unique
		-DNS is an example of such namespace

Namespace Policy
	-consistent namespaces make everyone's job easier
	-helps your users and admins find resources
	-a well-governed policy is the key to a consistent and reliable namespace
	-the policy should have collision prevention for flat namespaces
	-once you decide on a naming convention, it is difficult to change it
	-if there's one thing you should do by committee its namespace policy creation
	-ITS-PRinter-MH250-01

Issues surrounding namespaces
	-Protection
	-Longevity
	-Scope
	-Naming convention

Naming Conventions
	Formulaic, Themeatic, Functional, Descriptive, No Method, Applied uses are usually a combination of multiple approaches

Meta-directory
	Unified database of namespaces
	To create a named key for namespace
		-the information is added to meta-directory
		-the account is provisiond from the meta-directory to the resource itself
	Are namespace management
		-you can buy identity management software to implement a meta-directory or build your own
		-these solutions require a lot fo planning, deesign and testing

Directory 101
	Direcstory
		-a collection of information that is primarily searched and read, but rarely modified
		-named keys from namespace are idael storage candidates for directories

	Directory Service
		-provides access to direcotry information

	Directory Server
		-application that provides a directory service

	Note:
		-Directories are not Meta-directories. Directories store named keys, but do not provision them

LDAP(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
	lightweight version of the DAP based on the X.500 directories
	just access protocol, bot direcotry itself
	the directory must be implemented on server end

	Directory services which implement LDAP
		-Open LDAP
		-Fedora Directory Server

	Structure
		-Hierachal structure
			-containers are called organizational units
		-An LDAP directory is made of entries
			-entries may be employee records, hosts, accounts etc.
		-Each entry consists of attributes
			-names, phone numbers, etc.
			-objectClass attrbiute identifies schema
			-Schema determines available entry
		-Each attribte is a type/value pair
			-type is label for the information stored
			-value is value for attr.
			-attr. can be multi valued

LDAP DN
	distinguished name represents the path from the root directory to the entry

LDAP Authentication
	Anonymous authentication- binds with empty DN and password
	Simple auth- binds with DN and password
	Simple auth over SSL/TLS- use SSL to encrypt simple auth
	Simple auth and security layer- SASL is an extensible security measure scheme

Active Directory
	Active Directory service
	used to manage users and computers on the enterprise
	hiearchy: forest, trees, domains
	namespace is flat at the domain level
	AD implemented for user, group, computer, policies, and more
	Kerberos used for computers on the domain and user logons
	DNS is used for naming computers on the domain

Documentation
	Process of keeping records for the purpose of referencing information at a later time or for use by others
	What should be documents?
		-what you need later in time
		-dont try to document everything
		-dont overcomplicate documentation
	What- complex procedures, screen captures, source code
	How- templates, tools
	Why- train other staff, eliminate songle-person dependencies, reduce support calls, justify need for additional staff
	Create a document template for similar types of documentation
