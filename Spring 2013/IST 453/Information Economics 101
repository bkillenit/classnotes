Basic economic concpets that apply to the information and telecommunications fields such as:
	-Fixed and variable costs
	-economies of scale- cost advantages that enterprises obtain due to size, with cost per unit of output generally decreasing with increasing scale as fixed costs are spread out over more units of output
		-affects information vs. physical goods (chair vs. webpage)
		-information services are more scalable
	-ARPU(Average Revenue Per User)
	-network externalities:
		positive- compounded by size and shape of network, potential for more congestion, cybercrime  
		negative- alot of people on a hotspot make it slower, cap on how valuable it can be
	-5% acceptable loss rate: financial industry
	-elasticity: prices change depenent on demand, inelastic means prices are pretty much fixed
	-substitutes
	-natural monopolies: exe. National Grid is natural monopolies because it is more economical to exist in this one firm
